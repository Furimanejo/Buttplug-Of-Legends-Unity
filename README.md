# Buttplug-Of-Legends-Unity

## About
This is an windows app based on https://github.com/kinkyacedev/buttplug-of-legends.

It monitors your League of Legends gameplay and creates a score based on the actions you perform, like killing enemies/destroying turrets. 
Then that score is used to control the connected devices (device intensity is maxed when at 100 points or more).

This app was made using Unity Engine and [Buttplug](https://buttplug.io/), an open-source standards and software project for controlling intimate hardware, including sex toys, fucking machines, and more.

This app uses the official LoL API to get the data needed, and it doesn't inject code or modify the game behavior, So I think it's pretty safe to use but I can't garantee that riot won't ban over this.

Remember to always play safe, sane and consensual. Please, _**do not drag unsuspecting players into your play**_.
